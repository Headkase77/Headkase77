# **Who is Headkase77?**

## 👋 Hi, I’m @Headkase77
  My _Username_ stems back to my High School days when my friends and I came up with it for a band we were putting together. The band lasted the duration of high school
  until we graduated and went our separate ways. After buying my first Xbox in 2009 after my deployment to Afghanistan, I needed a username, and Headkase77 was born. It has been a staple for me since.

  So, who am I? My name is Josh, and I am a student at Montana State University. My degree program is a Bachelor of Arts in Computer Science with a Dual Major in Psychology.
  Programming is something I have dabbled in at various points in my life, and while I had fun with it (Including the time I programmed a rudimentary virus to play a prank on my dad), I never pursued it.
  Earlier this year (2023), I was confronted with a decision and presented with an opportunity to return to school at 35.
  I decided to take it, and here I am. 

- 👀 Things I am interested in include playing guitar (21 years), riding snowmobiles in the Mountains around Montana and Idaho, working to help veterans struggling with mental health, and sitting around
     a warm firepit on the cooler nights. 
- 🌱 I am currently learning Python, German, AWS, and GitHub. The IT and CS world is still very new to me, and the learning curve has been steep. I welcome any and all advice. 

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects involving NumPy, Pandas, and MatPlotLib. During this section of my last class, I enjoyed working with CSV files and creating graphic representations of data. I would like to work with learning projects for students (if such a thing exists).

- 📫 How to reach me: You can find me on Instagram: @The_Montana_Nomad, Facebook: Joshua Spillers, or here on GitHub.

I look forward to meeting and working with people here and becoming more fluent in using this incredible tool.
